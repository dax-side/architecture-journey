# Architecture Journey

A decision tree tool for picking architecture styles and databases. Ask questions about your project, get recommendations with trade-offs.

## Why This Exists

I kept choosing tech based on what was trending or what I already knew. This tool asks the right questions first: scalability needs, team size, deployment constraints. Then tells you what fits.

Two decision trees:
- Architecture styles (microservices, event-driven, layered, modular monolith)
- Database selection (relational, document, key-value, graph)

Each option shows pros, cons, and when to reconsider.
